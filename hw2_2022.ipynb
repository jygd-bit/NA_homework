Use a library routine for Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting to solve various sizes of linear systems of this form, using right-hand-side vectors chosen so that the solution is known. Try for example the case where the true solution is a vector of uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1. How do the error, residual, and condition number behave as the systems become larger? Comment on the stability (see chapter 1) of Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting in this case.\n",
